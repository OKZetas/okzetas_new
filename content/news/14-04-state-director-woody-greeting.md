## Welcome to the website of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. â€“ Outstanding State of Oklahoma!

I am delighted to extend greetings to you on behalf of the Sorors, Amicae and Archonettes in this great state. This web page is our way of communication with members in our state as well as sharing our legacy of service to others. As you peruse our website, you will find evidence that the Zeta family in the State of Oklahoma continues the legacy of Scholarship, Service, Sisterly Love, and Finer Womanhood that began in 1920 with founding of the sorority; and in 1927 when the first undergraduate chapter was chartered.

The State of Oklahoma is comprised of dedicated and hardworking members of the sorority who are committed to bettering our local communitites, our state, our country, and the world. We display this commitment through programming such as ZHOPE (Zetas Helping Other People Excel), our Stork's Nests, and our long-lasting partnerships with the March of Dimes and the American Cancer Society. Through countless hours of community service and donations, Zetas are definately making a difference!

If you are a soror in search of a Zeta home or would like to learn more about becoming a member of our illustrious organization, please contact us and someone will contact you with more information.


Again, thank you for taking the time to visit our website and we hope that the site has served its purpose for providing you information about Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. and our presence in Oklahoma.


Sisterly,


*Soror Artisha Harris-Woody*
**Oklahoma State Director**
