Congratulations to the Xi Nu Zeta chapter for celebrating their 28th charter anniversary today. These ladies are amazing and do amazing things for Oklahoma and our Sorority. Today's topic was **My Sisters Keeper**, learning one another's gifts and using them as resources to build up together as chapters, State, but mostly **AS WOMEN**. Continue to be the blessings that each of you ladies are, support one another and watch US GROW. #zphib1920
Sisterly,
