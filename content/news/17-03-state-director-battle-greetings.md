Welcome to the website of Zeta Phi Beta Sororty, Inc., Great State of Oklahoma. We encourage you to look at our website, [National website](http://zphib1920.org/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ZetaPhiBetaOklahomaState/) pages and other social media outlets to see what we do on the national, Regional, State, and local chapter levels. Zeta goes beyond undergraduate membership, it's a lifelong commitment. 

> We are driven by action , not words. Scholarship started it all, service drives our ambition, Sisterhood holds it all together, and Finer Womanhood Keeps Us looking good. We are the Great state of Oklahoma, where Zeta is moving forward in the Magnificent region of the Midwest. 

Our chapters here in Oklahoma are constantly serving with programs such as Pajamas-Books and Joy, Jr. Mr. Botillion and Miss Cotillion scholarship pageant, Christmas With The Zetas and Blue Santa, Medical Mondays and more. We also are very proud and eager to support national initiatives of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. such as ZHOPE, Prematurity Awareness, St. Jude Research Hospital, American Cancer Society, Storkâ€™s Nest, and many others.

It's time to get back to the basics of being positive women, wives, mothers, teachers, mentors, and community leaders. So whether you are browsing out of curiosity, interest in becoming a member, or even already a Soror, you are at the right place at the right time. Keep God first, and let the blessings flow. Come be apart of Oklahoma Zetas On The Move..... Now, what can we do for you.
