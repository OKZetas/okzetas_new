Soror Shelita Jones is a Soror’s Soror. Her smile, positive attitude, and spirit of volunteerism is contagious. She lends a hand to anyone in need. She is eager to learn more and more about Zeta and exhibits all the qualities that our beloved sorority was founded upon. She has been a member since 2010 and within that time she has held positions such as the Xi Nu Zeta chapter Sunshine chairperson, the Xi Nu Zeta chapter Tamias-Grammateus, and ZΦB State of Oklahoma ZHOPE coordinator. She was also named Xi Nu Zeta’s chapter member of the year for the 2012-2013 fiscal year. She has volunteered countless hours to her local chapter projects as well as the state’s initiatives and events. She has regular attendance at local meetings and she has also attended several state meetings as well as regional conference.

Soror Jones is an true asset to Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. and the sky is the limit on the potential she has for future leadership positions within the organization. I am proud to not only call her my Soror, but my friend as well.

 

Sisterly Submitted,
