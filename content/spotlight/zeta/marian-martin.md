I have known Soror Martin for about a decade now. The phrase that comes to mind when I think of her?

> When Zeta calls, we’ll answer one and all...

Most recently, I was called upon to collect and document the history of the state. I requested that each chapter submit a representative 
to the committee. Despite being the outgoing chapter historian for Chi Zeta, Soror Martin went above and beyond to make certain that their historical information was as accurate as possible before relinquishing her duties. She went a step further and provided historical data for both Beta Gamma and Theta Mu Chapters as well.

Thank you very much Soror Martin. You have truly put the “**Z**” in Zeta for me!

Sisterly,
*RJ Lewis*
