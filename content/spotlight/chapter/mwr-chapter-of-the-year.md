## Undergraduate Chapter of the Year

Boasting a delegation made up entirely of 1st time attendees, Basileus Lashonda Taylor and her fellow delegates worked hard before, during and after the conference.  Their undergraduate advisor, Soror LaTonya Anderson and the Beta Phi Zeta Graduate Chapter President, Soror Curtesia Smith, were present to witness these young ladies receive this honor.  They also competed and won the stroll off competition that was hosted by the Midwestern Region.  Congratulations to the sorors who were in attendance and those that were unable attend the leadership conference. 

## Graduate Chapter of the Year

Chi Zeta Chapter of Oklahoma City was presented with the Graduate Chapter of the Year plaque.  Having been active for over 50 years, the chapter was presented with two other awards for the 2013 Top Teams within the region for their fundraising efforts with the March of Dimes.
