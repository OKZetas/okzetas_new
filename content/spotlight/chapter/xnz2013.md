The Xi Nu Zeta Chapter of Midwest City, OK was charted in 1989.  Reactivated in 2004, the chapter participates in several national philanthropical community programs, as well as hosting local initiatives, including an Annual Community Picnic where they collect and disburse school supplies and award a scholarship.  They also host a group fitness activity - Strides for Your Heart and the Pajamas, Books and Joy reading program. 

Soror RJ Lewis and her committee did a beautiful job of putting together their scrapbook.
