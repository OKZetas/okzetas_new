We have a fairly strict comment policy on Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. - Oklahoma State website.  Our sorority was founded on the principles of scholarship, service, sisterhood and finer womanhood - please govern your commentary with that in mind.

More on finer commentary...

If your comment does not immediately appear on the site after posting, it may have been flagged for review. There are a number of things which will get your comment flagged for review, we ask that you please keep that in mind before resubmitting the comment multiple times or contacting us about it.

* Use of any of the curse words and/or slurs we have on our blacklist will automatically flag a comment so it won’t appear on our site. Sometimes these words are used as part of a good discussion, these comments will be approved by a moderator when appropriate.
* Using a Disqus account without a verified email address will automatically flag a comment.
* Fluctuations in the space time continuum. Sometimes things just get auto-flagged and we don’t know why.
* Comments can also be flagged for review by our readership (please do not abuse this option for other users you simply disagree with, it makes our moderation jobs a lot harder).

### Here are some things which will get your comment deleted.

 - Personal attacks against another commenter or the writer of the post/website. This can run from name calling to sentences which include the words “people like you” or statements which begin “I bet you” or “you must/probably” etc. This is regardless of what “side” you’re on.
 * Jokes or aggressive negative comments on the aesthetic appearance of a person (commenters, writers, and folks mentioned in an article alike).
 * Hate speech or other clearly intentionally insulting behavior. This includes, but is not limited to: the use of the derogative words towards any people, or persons based on gender, race, ethnicity, religious preference, or other generalized grouping.
