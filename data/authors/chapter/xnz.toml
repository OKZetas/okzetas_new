history = """Xi Nu Zeta was awarded a certificate of chartership on March 10, 1989 under the leadership and authority of the then Grand Basileus, Eunice S. Thomas. The initiation and charter ceremony was conducted by the then Oklahoma State Director, Lawanna Hackner Bruner. The Xi Nu Zeta chapter became the 2nd graduate chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority in the Oklahoma City area. The other of course being Chi Zeta Chapter founded on Dec. 14, 1936. The first basileus for the Xi Nu Zeta Chapter was Soror Mary T. Williams. Some of the other first officers of the chapter were Annette Ware (1st Vice President), Regina Anderson Woodberry (2nd Vice President) Verlean Delaney (Secretary) and Willie Ann Wood (Treasurer).

Some projects in which the chapter participated were: Adopt a Family, a career fair and College Entrance Exam Preparation. The chapter provided Christmas presents and delivered a dinner basket to a needy family. The chapter also had a toy drive to give needy families toys, through the Department of Human Services. The career fair at The Midwest City Community Center, was designed to expose junior and senior high school students to careers that were expected to be in demand in the future. Also, Xi Nu Zeta hosted a free seminar on college entrance exams at the Midwest City Library. This was done to review with students the subjects that were commonly tested and prepare them for entrance to college.
